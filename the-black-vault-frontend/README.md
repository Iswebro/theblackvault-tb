## Leaderboard System

### Weekly & Lifetime Referral Leaderboards

The Black Vault features both weekly and lifetime referral leaderboards to track top performers.

#### Weekly Leaderboard

- **Reset Schedule**: Every Monday at 7:00 AM AEST (Brisbane Time)
- **Tracking Period**: 7-day rolling windows from launch
- **Data Source**: On-chain `Deposited` events with referral rewards calculation
- **Display**: Top 10 referrers by weekly referral rewards earned

#### Lifetime Leaderboard

- **Tracking Period**: All-time since contract launch
- **Data Source**: All historical `Deposited` events
- **Display**: Top 10 referrers by total referral rewards earned

### Off-chain Aggregation

#### Weekly Leaderboard Script

\`\`\`bash
# Run weekly leaderboard aggregation
npm run leaderboard:weekly
\`\`\`

The script (`scripts/weeklyLeaderboard.js`) should be scheduled to run via cron:

\`\`\`bash
# Crontab entry for Monday 7 AM AEST (UTC+10)
# Note: Adjust for daylight saving time if needed
0 21 * * 0 cd /path/to/project && npm run leaderboard:weekly
\`\`\`

**Brisbane Time Cron Schedule:**
- **Standard Time (AEST)**: `0 21 * * 0` (Sunday 9 PM UTC = Monday 7 AM AEST)
- **Daylight Time (AEDT)**: `0 20 * * 0` (Sunday 8 PM UTC = Monday 7 AM AEDT)

#### Data Storage

Leaderboard data is stored in JSON files:
- `leaderboard-data/week-{index}.json` - Weekly leaderboard data
- `leaderboard-data/lifetime.json` - Lifetime leaderboard data

### API Endpoints

#### GET /api/leaderboard/weekly

Returns the current week's referral leaderboard.

**Response:**
\`\`\`json
{
  "weekIndex": 5,
  "weekStart": 1719273600,
  "weekEnd": 1719878400,
  "generatedAt": 1719850000,

    }
  ]
}
\`\`\`

- Updates automatically when new data is available

#### Lifetime Leaderboard (Modal)

### Technical Details

#### Week Calculation

\`\`\`javascript
const LAUNCH_TIMESTAMP = 1718668800 // 7am Brisbane time 17 June 2024
const WEEK_DURATION = 7 * 24 * 60 * 60 // 7 days in seconds
const currentWeekIndex = Math.floor((nowTs - LAUNCH_TIMESTAMP) / WEEK_DURATION)
\`\`\`

#### Referral Reward Calculation

- **Bonus Rate**: 10% of deposit amount
- **Eligibility**: First 3 deposits per referrer-referee pair
- **Verification**: Uses `getReferralBonusInfo()` contract function

#### Block Time Estimation

The script estimates block numbers from timestamps using BSC's ~3 second average block time for efficient event querying.

### Deployment Notes

1. **Environment Variables**: Ensure `REACT_APP_CONTRACT_ADDRESS` and `REACT_APP_RPC_URL` are set
2. **Data Directory**: Create `leaderboard-data/` directory with write permissions
3. **Cron Setup**: Configure cron job for weekly aggregation
4. **API Routes**: Deploy API endpoints to your hosting platform
5. **Time Zone**: Verify cron runs in correct timezone (Brisbane/AEST)

## Building for Production

\`\`\`bash
npm run build
\`\`\`

This creates an optimized build in the `build/` directory.

## Deployment

### Vercel (Recommended)

1. Connect your GitHub repository to Vercel
2. Set environment variables in Vercel dashboard
3. Deploy automatically on push to main branch

### Manual Deployment

1. Build the project: `npm run build`
2. Upload `build/` directory to your hosting provider
3. Configure environment variables on your hosting platform

## Testing

### Local Testing

1. Start local development server: `npm start`
2. Connect with MetaMask on BSC Testnet
3. Test deposit/withdraw flows with test BNB

### Testnet Testing

1. Switch to BSC Testnet in MetaMask
2. Get test BNB from BSC Testnet faucet
3. Update `.env` with testnet contract address
4. Test all functionality end-to-end

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Wallet won't connect**
- Ensure you're using MetaMask or Trust Wallet in-app browser
- Check that BSC network is added to your wallet

**Transaction fails**
- Ensure sufficient BNB balance for gas fees
